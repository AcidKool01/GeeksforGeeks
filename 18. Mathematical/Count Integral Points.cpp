// The idea is to find the equation of the line in simplest form, i.e., in equation ax + by +c, 
// coefficients a, b and c become co-prime. We can do this by calculating the GCD (greatest common divisor) of a, b and c 
// and convert a, b and c in the simplest form. 
// Then, the answer will be (difference of y coordinates) divided by (a) â€“ 1. 
// This is because after calculating ax + by + c = 0, for different y values, x will be number of y values which are exactly divisible by a.
